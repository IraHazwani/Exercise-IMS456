        <p style="font-size: 20"> I woke up at 8:00 a.m in the morning. After that I took shower and make some morning routine such as wearing skincare product.Since today is Sunday, so I decided to do some house chores, but before that I took some breakfast first. Usually when I am taking breakfast I will have a morning chit chat with my family. After that I start sweep and mop the floor, remove all the dust in the ceiling and the fan, and then I change the layout of the furniture and bed in my room. It was pretty fun actually &#128518; because it can make you feel better when you see things organized.</p>

Then, I helped my mother to cook for lunch (by the way, the picture below is from google hihi). After that, we have lunch together at 1310 in the afternoon. After that I do the dishes and rest for a while. Since the day was very hot I decided to make some fruit cocktail drink &#128523; It was very tasty and refreshes the throat!</p>

      <p style="font-size: 35"><b>My Night Routine II &#127772;</b><p style="font-size: 15">After all the work is done, I wash my face and do my night beauty routine. Then I usually scroll through my instagram or playing games or watch some korean drama. Before I go to bed since the next day is Monday (where my online classes begin &#128514;) I brushed my teeth and after that, I set the alarm for the next day and switch the lights off, usually before 12:00 am. Iâ€™ve been trying to go to bed earlier but have not been succeeded so far. (To be honest, my sleep time since this MCO was so uncertain &#128514;)</p>
